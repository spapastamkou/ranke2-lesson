### 2.a Finding and accessing historical data
    
The search of historical sources for the purpose of a given research involves operations of discovery and localizing for accessing, and eventually using (i.e. make a digital or other copy, take notes, etc to be able to analyze) historical materials of interest. An essential factor for discovering these materials, be they born-digital, digitized, or of any analog materiality, is their description in dedicated catalogs, that function as finding aids.

Depending on the context, these descriptions may use norms, i.e. rules agreed by professional communities such as archivists and librarians, or they can be more flexible functional systems at the level of a community, team or an individual. In either case, the aim is to establish intelligible and stable ways to find one's way around a plethora of resources, something like when we need to pick our way among autoroutes, and we use road signs that many recognize to signify the same things.

In web environments, discoverability can additionally be ensured by what we call full indexation of the content of textual resources - picture this as if each word of a text was underlined to make it evident. In this way, it becomes findable, even if the descriptive information for the whole text is absent or not systematic (with the inherent risk of having fragmented information outside of its original context of creation/classification, and for this reason subject to caution to analyze and interpret, but we will not focus on this at this point!).

The abundance of historical primary sources that are digitally available and accessible on the web opened the debate among historians about visibility and consequent prominence of digitized materials versus a, sometimes perceived as silent, non-digitized cultural heritage (Putnam 2016, Milligan 2013). However, not all historical records can be digitally available, and the majority of the holdings of the archives and libraries is still not. Nevertheless, what is important is to somehow find out that these records exist, when we look for them. Which is why digital availability of descriptive information on the historical records, independently from their materiality, is precious (Zaagsma 2022). In other words, what we call with the fancy name ["metadata"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) is essential for historians to be able to discover, localize, and contextualize their sources in order to analyze and interpret them, which is an essential part of the work they are supposed to do. 

In this assignment, you will work with a print postcard that is part of the [art event ephemera collection](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/michael-cummings-african-american-art-event-ephemera-collection) of [Michael A. Cummings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_A._Cummings), US artist and collector of ephemeral art of Black and Latino artists. The collection is held at the Arthur Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, that is part of the New York Public Library (herafter NYPL). The postcard is only physically accessible in the cultural heritage institution that preserves it in New York, USA. The postcard, as the whole collection it belongs to, was digitized, for this reason its description is provided by the Digital Collections of the NYPL.
> [Ephemera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemera) is the generic term to define printed documents that escape the established categories of documentation subject to legal deposit that one finds in libraries (books, journals, etc). These documents were created to vehiculate information born to be obsolete: tracts, posters, pamphlets, postcards... As they often seize the *Zeitgeist* of an era, these materials can be valuable sources for historical research. 

Please check the description and explore the information contained with the help of the questions we propose below.  

[Postcard announcing "In the Hollow of Your Hand, Slave Lullabies"](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/c8f7da00-f0d8-013a-196c-0242ac110003).

The link above points towards the live page on NYPL. If you have trouble accessing it, please consult [an archived page available on Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20230627212542/https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/c8f7da00-f0d8-013a-196c-0242ac110003). If necessary, you may use [an archived file of the page available on Ranke.2 repository](/documents/Postcard_Slave_Lullabies_NYPL.htm) - you first need to download this file, then open it with locally with your usual browser.  

Observe carefully the page of the description you have in front of you. 
You will notice that there is not an image that you can view and inspect online or download to study it carefully on your own environment. 

* Why is there not a standalone, good quality image not available? Note than often times this kind of information is explained in a special section explaining the rights of use of a resource or with specific logos. 
* What information can you find about the ways you can access this object if you wish to work closely with it? 
* Is there any way at all to see what the postcard looks like from your computer? 
 <!-- No digitized image available: there is though: something that looks like a thumbnail. A clear indication, visually, that the image can be seen at the Schomburg Center and a map is provided next to it. It is only possible to physically access the object if one wants to inspect it further (or have it reproduced?)-->

Now, forget the image of the postcard! Available or not, you still need to check the information that is provided **about** its provenances and context of creation, in case you need to work with it as a source. 

First, spot the elements that allow you to **identify** the resource and **contextualize its creation**. Typically, these are the elements historians use to cite their sources, such as the name of author or any type of creator involved, a title, a date (of creation, publication etc.), a collection of which the object may be part, the archive that houses the resource, an identification number... This list is not necessarily exhaustive, so be aware that you might find more or less of these elements. Check your findings and note more elements of identification, if any. 

<!--This information helps understand the origin and authenticate at least the provenance of the item. This is what we ausually do with our sources!!-->
Creators, dates and places of production are already important information of context to help verify the provenance and authenticity of a source. But you can understand also a lot about context by the broader settings a resource may be part of. Pay special attention to the information about the collection the resource is part of. You can also check additional information, for example [the bibliographic description in the library's catalog](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b14968343) that is also provided in the page. If you are careful, you will notice that the latter gives also access to an ancient bibliographic description, which helps you track, even historicize, its bilbiographic descriptions. Keep in mind that these are high quality metadata, since they provide complementary levels of contextualization and allow you to track - and possibly historicize - the evolution of the description of the item. <!-- The bibliographic record of the postcard shows there was a selection to individualize this resource to make it findable, but the description actually is this if the book; the record of the collection, that is accessible from the identifier provided in the record of the digitized postcard,  -->
* Reading only the above description of the collection and eventually the Wikipedia article on the [Schomburg Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schomburg_Center_for_Research_in_Black_Culture) that holds the collection, what can you conclude about the broader environment of the postcard as source? How could you relate it to social and cultural evolutions in the United States in America in the 20th and 21st c.? 

Finally read the [bibliographic description of the print postcard in the research catalog of the NYPL]()  



the information about this resource is accessible event though the resource is either inaccessible in distance (its digital representation) or acvcessible under conditions (the physical item is accessible in the institution it is preserved if you are able to go there).  


Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable
