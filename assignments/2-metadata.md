### 2.a Finding and accessing historical data
    
The search of historical sources for the purpose of a given research involves operations of discovery and localizing for accessing, and eventually using (i.e. make a digital or other copy, take notes, etc to be able to analyze) historical materials of interest. An essential factor for discovering these materials, be they born-digital, digitized, or of any analog materiality, is their description in dedicated catalogs, that function as finding aids.

Depending on the context, these descriptions may use norms, i.e. rules agreed by professional communities such as archivists and librarians, or they can be more flexible functional systems at the level of a community, team or an individual. In either case, the aim is to establish agreed ways to find one's way around a plethora of resources, something like when we need to pick our way among autoroutes, and we use representations recognizable by many to signify the same things, as with road signs.

In web environments, discoverability can additionally be ensured by full indexation of the content of textual resources - picture this like underlining each word to make it evident -, even if the descriptive information is absent or not systematic (with the inherent risk of having fragmented information outside of its original context of creation/classification, and for this reason subject to caution to analyze and interpret, but we will not focus on this at this point!).

The abundance of historical primary sources that are digitally available and accessible on the web opened the debate among historians about visibility and consequent prominence of digitized materials versus a, sometimes perceived as silent, non-digitized cultural heritage (Putnam 2016, Milligan 2013). However, not all historical records can be digitally available, and the majority of the holdings of the archives and libraries is still not. Nevertheless, what is important is to somehow find out that these records exist, when we look for them. Which is why digital availability of descriptive information on the historical records, independently from their materiality, is precious (Zaagsma 2022). In other words, what we call with the fancy name ["metadata"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) is essential for historians to be able to discover, localize, and contextualize their sources or, to cut a long stroy short, to just do the work they are supposed to do. 

In this assignment, you will work with a print postcard that is part of the [art event ephemera collection](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/michael-cummings-african-american-art-event-ephemera-collection) of [Michael A. Cummings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_A._Cummings), US artist and collector of ephemeral art of Black and Latino artists. The collection is held at the Arthur Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, that is part of the New York Public Library (herafter NYPL). The postcard is only physically accessible in the cultural heritage institution that preserves it in New York, USA.
> [Ephemera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemera) is the generic term to define printed documents that escape the established categories of documentation subject to legal deposit that one finds in libraries (books, journals, etc). These documents were created to vehiculate information born to be obsolete: tracts, posters, pamphlets, postcards... As they often seize the *Zeitgeist* of an era, these materials can be valuable sources for historical research. 

As the whole collection was digitized, the description of the digitized record is provided by the Digital Collections of the NYPL. Please check the description and explore the information contained with the help of the questions we propose. In the end, you should be able to understand the implications of the existence of (rich) metadata for the the work of a historian. 

[Postcard announcing "In the Hollow of Your Hand, Slave Lullabies"](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/c8f7da00-f0d8-013a-196c-0242ac110003).

The link above points towards the live page, if necessary please consult [an archived page available on Ranke.2 repository](/documents/Postcard_Slave_Lullabies_NYPL.htm). You will first need to downloaf this file and then open it with your usual browser.  

Observe the page of the description you have in front of you. 
First of all, can you see what the postcard looks like? You will notice that there is not an image that you can view and inspect online, download, and eventually share (by including it in a publication, or by integrating it in a website)? What are the ways you can access this object if you wish to work with it? <!-- No digitized image available, except something that looks like a thumbnail. A clear indication, visually, that the image can be seen at the Schomburg Center and a map is provided next to it. It is only possible to physically access the object if one wants to inspect it further (or have it reproduced?)-->

Now, forget the image of the postcard! Even if it was available, you would still need to check the information that is available **about** the object to understand more, in case you needed to include it in your research. 

First, spot the elements that allow you to **identify** the resource. Typically, these are the elements historians use to cite their sources, such as: 
- Author or creator's name
- Title of the work
- Date
- Publication information (place, publisher)
- Collection name
- Box and folder, if applicable, or any element that helps to localize the resource in the repository that holds it (the materiality of the resource can determine this element)
- Repository (archive that houses the resource)
- Identification number

This list is meant to help you but it is not necessarily exhaustive, so be aware that you might find more or less of these elements. Check what you find and note more elements of identification, if any. 

<!--This information helps understand the origin and authenticate at least the provenance of the item. This is what we ausually do with our sources!!-->

  
This record was created for a digitized item that is part of a print book. The digital - albeit non available - image and the individual record, alias metadata implementation, materialize how elements of an initial setting can become individual distinctly identifiable data. Now look for the information that **provides context** about how this postcard was created, by whom, the borader settings it is part of and anything you find meaningful from this point of view. Pay special attention to the information about the collection the resource is part of. You can also check additional sources, for example [the bibliographic record in the library's catalog](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b14968343). If you are careful, you will notice that the latter gives also access to an ancient bibliographic description. Keep in mind that these are high quality metadata, since they provide complementary levels of contextualization and allow you to track - and possibly historicize - the evolution of the description of the item. <!-- The bibliographic record of the postcard shows there was a selection to individualize this resource to make it findable, but the description actually is this if the book; the record of the collection, that is accessible from the identifier provided in the record of the digitized postcard,  -->

Finally, explore the aids provided to help you understand how you can reuse  
    


If you set apart the access to the image of the resource, 

information that allows you to know that this image exists, to identify it and to find it or relevant information about it

information that allows you to understand the context of creation of this resource

information that links to information available in other institutions 


the information about this resource is accessible event though the resource is either inaccessible in distance (its digital representation) or acvcessible under conditions (the physical item is accessible in the institution it is preserved if you are able to go there).  


Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable
