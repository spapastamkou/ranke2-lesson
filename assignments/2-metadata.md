### 2.a Reading descriptions of historical data: the mediation of the archive
    
The search of historical sources for the purpose of a given research involves operations of discovery and localizing for accessing, and eventually using (i.e. make a digital or other copy, take notes, etc to be able to analyze) historical materials of interest. An essential factor for discovering these materials, be they born-digital, digitized, or of any analog materiality, is their description in dedicated catalogs, that function as finding aids.

Depending on the context, these descriptions may use norms, i.e. rules agreed by professional communities such as archivists and librarians, or they can be more flexible functional systems at the level of a community, team or an individual. In either case, the aim is to establish intelligible and stable ways to find one's way around a plethora of resources, something like when we need to pick our way among autoroutes, and we use road signs that many recognize to signify the same things.

In web environments, discoverability can additionally be ensured by what we call full indexation of the content of textual resources - picture this as if each word of a text was underlined to make it evident. In this way, it becomes findable, even if the descriptive information for the whole text is absent or not systematic (with the inherent risk of having fragmented information outside of its original context of creation/classification, and for this reason subject to caution to analyze and interpret, but we will not focus on this at this point!).

The abundance of historical primary sources that are digitally available and accessible on the web opened the debate among historians about visibility and consequent prominence of digitized materials versus a, sometimes perceived as silent, non-digitized cultural heritage (Putnam 2016, Milligan 2013). However, not all historical records can be digitally available, and the majority of the holdings of the archives and libraries is still not. Nevertheless, what is important is to somehow find out that these records exist, when we look for them. Which is why digital availability of descriptive information on the historical records, independently from their materiality, is precious (Zaagsma 2022). In other words, what we call with the fancy name ["metadata"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) is essential for historians to be able to discover, localize, and contextualize their sources in order to analyze and interpret them, which is an essential part of the work they are supposed to do. 

In this assignment, you will work with a print postcard that is part of the [art event ephemera collection](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/michael-cummings-african-american-art-event-ephemera-collection) of [Michael A. Cummings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_A._Cummings), US artist and collector of ephemeral art of Black and Latino artists. The collection is held at the Arthur Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, that is part of the New York Public Library (herafter NYPL). The postcard is only physically accessible in the cultural heritage institution that preserves it in New York, USA. The postcard, as the whole collection it belongs to, was digitized, for this reason its description is provided by the Digital Collections of the NYPL.
> [Ephemera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemera) is the generic term to define printed documents that escape the established categories of documentation subject to legal deposit that one finds in libraries (books, journals, etc). These documents were created to vehiculate information born to be obsolete: tracts, posters, pamphlets, postcards... As they often seize the *Zeitgeist* of an era, these materials can be valuable sources for historical research. 

Please check the description and explore the information contained with the help of the questions we propose below.  

[Postcard announcing "In the Hollow of Your Hand, Slave Lullabies"](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/c8f7da00-f0d8-013a-196c-0242ac110003).

The link above points towards the live page on NYPL. If you have trouble accessing it, please consult [an archived page available on Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20230627212542/https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/c8f7da00-f0d8-013a-196c-0242ac110003). If necessary, you may use [an archived file of the page available on Ranke.2 repository](/documents/Postcard_Slave_Lullabies_NYPL.htm) - you first need to download this file, then open it with locally with your usual browser.  

Observe carefully the page of the description you have in front of you. 

* Is an image of the postcard available to inspect and download in order to work closer with it? Note than often times this kind of information is explained in a special section explaining the rights of use of a resource or with specific logos. 
* What information can you find about the ways you can access this object if you wish to work closely with it? 
* Is there any way at all to see what the postcard looks like from your computer? 
 <!-- No digitized image available: there is though: something that looks like a thumbnail. A clear indication, visually, that the image can be seen at the Schomburg Center and a map is provided next to it. It is only possible to physically access the object if one wants to inspect it further (or have it reproduced?)-->

Now, forget the image of the postcard! Available or not, you still need to check the information that is provided **about** its context of creation: if you needed to work with it as a source, these elements help you to verify provenance, authenticity and judge the reliability of your source. 

First, spot the elements that allow you to **identify** the resource and **contextualize its creation**. Typically, these are the chunks of information historians use to cite their sources, such as the name of author or any type of creator involved, a title, a date (of creation, publication etc.), a collection of which the object may be part, the archive that houses the resource, an identification number... This list is not necessarily exhaustive, so be aware that you might find more or less of these elements. Check your findings and note which elements of identification, if any. 

<!--This information helps understand the origin and authenticate at least the provenance of the item. This is what we ausually do with our sources!!-->
Creators, dates and places of production are already important information of context to help verify the provenance and authenticity of a source. Besides these, pay special attention to the information about the collection the resource is part of: you can understand a lot about context by the broader environment a resource may be part of. Check additional information, for example [the bibliographic description in the library's catalog](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b14968343) that is also provided in the page about the collection the postcard is part of. 

* Reading only the above description of the collection and eventually the Wikipedia article on the [Schomburg Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schomburg_Center_for_Research_in_Black_Culture) that holds the collection, what can you conclude about the broader environment of the postcard as source? How could you relate it to social and cultural evolutions in the United States in America in the 20th and 21st c.? 

If you are careful, you will observe that the notices of the library's catalog gives also access to ancient bibliographic descriptions. Keep in mind that these are high quality metadata, since they provide complementary levels of contextualization and allow you to track - and possibly historicize - the evolution of the description of the item. <!-- The bibliographic record of the postcard shows there was a selection to individualize this resource to make it findable, but the description actually is this if the book; the record of the collection, that is accessible from the identifier provided in the record of the digitized postcard,  -->


Finally, try to search the same object, the postcard, in the library's catalog, using the title that is provided in the notice of the digitized item. The first result of your research should be the following [bibliographic description](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b14968343). Give it a quick read: you see that the record it describes is actually the book of which the postcard is part of. No specific information is provided about the postcard itself, although the book's description and keywords can give hints about the object from its collective setting. 

This means that if you did not know the postcard existed, and you relied only on the information provided in the catalog, you would have no means to find this object, unless taking a close look to the book and discovering among the other things your broader interest on the subject made you examine. 

Do you understand now how, 
* first, digitizing the postcard separately from the book it is part of 
* second, describing it as a unit independently from the book
* third, making this information openly accessible in the open web 
made it eventually possible to find that this item exists, even if it is not immediately accessible online?  


## 2.b Digital forensics: data abundance, metadata scarcity 
Now let's explore the inverse case: a digital resource being available without restriction but the descriptive information is missing. 

Let's take the example of the [September 11 Digital Archive](https://911digitalarchive.org/). Initially [an academic-led project](https://rrchnm.org/portfolio-item/the-september-11-digital-archive/), this digital-born archive was created in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001 to serve as repository of digital materials (photos, emails, personal accounts...) and keep the record of the event. The project crowdsourced digital materials in a pre-social web era, meaning that at the time onine social networks like Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, that served later for people publishing first responses and reactions in times of crisis, did not exist yet. 

Work with this photo randomly discovered in the collection of photography of the archive: [Link to the photo of people looking the first tour of the World Trade Center collapsing](https://911digitalarchive.org/items/show/35743). 

* Explore what information is available in the description. What do you find? Can you contextualize and authenticate the image with the existing information - where and when the photo was taken, and by whom?   

You may have to play the detective here! Try a reverse image search using a specialized service that you can easily find on the web. Skip any result leading to an embedded publication of the image, i.e. when it is used as illustration in a text (this is a secondary use we are not interested in here!) and focus on platforms that serve as repositories for users. Doing so, you will find [the same image published on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/8171202@N07/1507620222). 
> [Flickr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flickr) is an online social network founded in 2004, where users publish their photos and make them available to other users. The uses of the network are various, but since the early days of its existence it served for communicating and sharing information in times of crisis, such as the 2005 terrorist attacks in London.

Inspect the web page of the image on Flickr. Here too, you find descriptive information. It may not look exactly like the kind of the information available in an archive or library catalog, and this is normal: Flickr is not a patrimonial insitution that preserves historical records, it is a corporate business that makes available a social networking platform, enabling to publish specific content: photos. However, its architecture also provides a repository that needs to keep its resources organized. Thus, despite the different purpose, it still has universal needs of information organisation. Hence the common points with an archive: for example, you can find information about the creator, various dates, tags, which is a form of indexation, and precisions on rights of use. <!--have this here in details? Keep it to build an exercise comparing a notice of flickr with the notice of NYPL?--> 

* Compare the information you find on the image on the Flickr web page, directly or indirectly, about: 
    * who appears as author of the photo
    * where the photo was taken
    * when the photo was taken
    * what it represents
    * any collection the photo may be part of

By combining the two sources of the photo, the September 11 Digital Archive and Flickr, do you think you have more information that helps you identify and contextualize this photo? Do you still have missing pieces in the puzzle or unsure information? What are these? For example, how can you be sure about the author and the date the photo was taken? The context of the web favors reuse and remediations, for example photos are posted and reposted frequently by different social media accounts: sometimes the user posting is the creator but often they are not.  

There is one more source of information that could be useful in such cases or in general: the embedded metadata that are automatically generated as soon as a digital file is created in a device. These metadata provide a combination of information about the structure, the technical and the cration context of a file. For example, if you inspect the file of a photo taken with your mobile phone, you may find information about the origin of the image, including the author and the date taken, decriptions of its technical caracteristics as well as those of the device used, geographical coordinates, etc. This information is not always complete, but it may prove useful when it is there. 

Let us now inspect the file of the image we are working with from the September 11 Digital Archive. You will find below a screenshot taken once the image was saved from the archive to a personal computer and then opened in the system (running on Windows 11) with right click. You can follow the description based on the screenshot but you can repeat the manipulation as described below.     

[Screenshot](/images/2-911-archive--photo-embedded-metadata-2025-06-05%20184848.jpg) of the downloaded file of the image from the September 11 Digital Archive.

![Embedded metadata of the downloaded file of the image from the September 11 Digital Archive, screenshot, 5 June 2025](/images/2-911-archive-photo-embedded-metadata-2025-06-05.jpg "Screenshot of the downloaded file of the image from the September 11 Digital Archive, 5 June 2025") 

Inspect the metadata that are stored in the image file. To do so, you download the image from the archive, you save it where you prefer locally and open it with right click. Explore the information each tab offers. The first tab "General" contains information that was automatically generated at the moment the file was created locally in your computer's system. What is much more interesting in our case, is the tab "Details" and the information it contains in the "Description" and "Origin" sections. There you can find interesting things such as the title, author, date taken, and rights of use. 

When information is available in these sections, it is not automatically generated, but manually added by the creator of the file or someone who has rights to do so, using dedicated computer built-in or software tools. Unless there is a sort of digital certificate, this information remains subject to caution as for its integrity. However, in this case, we can rely on the mediation of the archive: because this image file is part of an archive it is possible to identify, we can trust the integrity of information added about the provenance and authenticity of the photo.      

* Given the above, what elements of context are you likely to confirm now about the photo? 7

* Now think: if you witnessed an exceptional event and made a photo of it in real time: 
    * Would you share this photo? 
    * If yes, in what way: email, website, an online social network, submit to an archive, other...
    * What are the possible means you could use to describe it?

### 2.c Creating metadata: the standard and the personal (and the third way) 

* A photo of the collection "Belleville Fire Department" dating from the beginning of the 1990s, preserved by the Community Archives of Belleville and Hastings County (Belleville, Ontario, Canada) and exposed freely on Flickr Commons. [URL](https://www.flickr.com/photos/cabhc/) 

Inspect the tags. (to see how different they are from controlled vocabularies and initiate to folksonomies). Click on one and observe what this does (creates a network of resources tagged with the same word with different provenance and different status but with thematic affinity)


Now compare with the bibliographic description you worked with in 2.a: [bibliographic description](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b14968343). Observe what appears in the category "Subject". 





### 2.d On authenticity: who is the author? 

*Authorship/creation/contribution - tbc* 

Check the following record descriptions or descriptive resources and focus on the creator(s) and date of creation - be aware you may find various terms and multiple roles in each case (for example: a date of creation can be a date of publication in one case but a date a resource was posted on social media, in another case).


* An illustration of a Persian manuscript of the 17th century held at and digitized by the British Library: [URL for illustration of Nizami's Khamsa](https://imagesonline.bl.uk/asset/1953)
* A photograph from the First World War available on Europeana: [James Gerrard Boyd on horse](https://www.europeana.eu/en/item/2020601/https___1914_1918_europeana_eu_contributions_16763_attachments_177965) 
* A meme of your choice from the [Meme Wall scholar-led project](https://memes.sucho.org/) - in this case you need to check not only the information that appears on the bottom left of the web page once you click on a meme image but also the About page and the CSV file that you download there.
