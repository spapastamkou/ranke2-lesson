title: Discovering, acceding to, and contextualizing historical data
learning-objectives: 
 - Understand how availability of descriptive information on historical records allows discoverability and contextualization of sources

### 2.a Finding and accessing historical data
    
The search of historical sources for the purpose of a given research involves operations of discovery and localizing for accessing, and eventually using (i.e. make a digital or other copy, take notes, etc to be able to analyze) historical materials of interest. An essential factor for discovering these materials, be they born-digital, digitized, or of any analog materiality, is their description in dedicated catalogs, that act as finding aids. The ways to describe can use norms, i.e. rules agreed by professional communities such as archivists and librarians, or more spontaneous functional systems at the level of a community, team or an individual. Discoverability, in web environments, can also be ensured by full indexation of textual resources, even if the descriptive information is absent of not systematic - in this case, however, the inherent risk is decontextualization, alias fragmented information outside of its original context of creation/classification, and for this reason subject to caution to analyze and interpret.

The abundance of historical primary sources that are digitally available and accessible on the web, opened the debate among historians about visibility and consequent prominence of digitized materials versus a, sometimes perceived as silent, non-digitized cultural heritage (Putnam 2016, Milligan 2013). It has been argued however that the real problem is the digital availability of descriptive information on the historical records, independently from their materiality and availability of these records (Zaagsma 2022). In other words, availability of metadata is essential for historians to be able to discover, localize, and contextualize their sources. 

In this assignment, you will work with a historical artefact, a print postcard, that is part of a digitized ephemera collection.
> [Ephemera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemera) is the generic term to define printed documents that escape the established categories of documentation subject to legal deposit that one finds in libraries (books, journals, etc). These documents were created to vehiculate information born to be obsolete: tracts, posters, pamphlets, postcards... As they often seize the *Zeitgeist* of an era, these materials can be valuable sources for historical research. 

Please check the following record available on the Digital Collections of the New York Public Library. The record describes a postcard that is part of the digitized [art event ephemera collection](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/michael-cummings-african-american-art-event-ephemera-collection) of [Michael A. Cummings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_A._Cummings), US artist and collector of ephemeral art of Black and Latino artists. The postcard is only physically accessible in the cultural heritage institution that preserves it, in New York, USA. Your point of entry will be the descriptive record of the digitized artefact. You will explore the granularity of the information contained and its implications for the the work of a historian. 

[Postcard announcing "In the Hollow of Your Hand, Slave Lullabies"](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/c8f7da00-f0d8-013a-196c-0242ac110003).

Observe what you have in front of you: can you see what the postcard looks like? Is there an image you can view, inspect, download, and eventually share (for example in a publication, or a website)? Is it an image with a quality that allows you to work with for an analysis? If not, is there a clear explanation for any restrictions tjhat are imposed?   

Now, even if you do not have full access to the image of the postcard, you still have quite a lot of information here.     
First, spot the elements that allow you to **identify** the resource. Typically, these are the elements historians use to cite their sources, such as: 
- Author or creator's name
- Title of the work
- Date
- Publication information (place, publisher)
- Collection name
- Box and folder, if applicable, or any element that helps to localize the resource in the repository that holds it (the materiality of the resource can determine this element)
- Repository (archive that houses the resource)
- Identification number

This list is meant to help you but it is not necessarily exhaustive, so be aware that you might find more or less of these elements. Check what you find and note more elements of identification, if any. 

  
This record was created for a digitized item that is part of a print book. The digital - albeit non available - image and the individual record, alias metadata implementation, materialize how elements of an initial setting can become individual distinctly identifiable data. Now look for the information that **provides context** about how this postcard was created, by whom, the borader settings it is part of and anything you find meaningful from this point of view. Pay special attention to the information about the collection the resource is part of. You can also check additional sources, for example [the bibliographic record in the library's catalog](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/bib/b14968343). If you are careful, you will notice that the latter gives also access to an ancient bibliographic description. Keep in mind that these are high quality metadata, since they provide complementary levels of contextualization and allow you to track - and possibly historicize - the evolution of the description of the item. <!-- The bibliographic record of the postcard shows there was a selection to individualize this resource to make it findable, but the description actually is this if the book; the record of the collection, that is accessible from the identifier provided in the record of the digitized postcard,  -->

Finally, explore the aids provided to help you understand how you can reuse  
    


If you set apart the access to the image of the resource, 

information that allows you to know that this image exists, to identify it and to find it or relevant information about it

information that allows you to understand the context of creation of this resource

information that links to information available in other institutions 


the information about this resource is accessible event though the resource is either inaccessible in distance (its digital representation) or acvcessible under conditions (the physical item is accessible in the institution it is preserved if you are able to go there).  


Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable
