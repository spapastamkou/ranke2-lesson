### 2.a Finding and acceding historical data
    
 

The search of historical sources for the purpose of a given research involves operations of discovery, localizing, access, and eventual use (i.e. make a digital or other copy, take notes, etc to be able to analyze) of historical materials of interest. An important factor for discovering these materials is their description in  

*Explore what happens when only metadata are available about the digital representation of a resource that is physically accessible only in the cultural heritage institution that preserves it.*

For this exercise, you will work with the record of a print postcard, that is part of a digitized ephemera collection. [Ephemera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemera) is the generic term to define printed documents that escape the established categories of documentation subject to legal deposit that one finds in libraries (books, journals, etc). These documents were created to vehiculate information born to be obsolete: tracts, posters, pamphlets, postcards... As they often seize the *Zeitgeist* of an era, these materials can be valuable sources for historical research. 
 

Please check the following record available on the Digital Collections of the New York Public Library. The record describes a postcard that is part of the digitized [art event ephemera collection](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/michael-cummings-african-american-art-event-ephemera-collection) of [Michael A. Cummings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_A._Cummings), US artist and collector of ephemeral art of Black and Latino artists.

[Postcard announcing "In the Hollow of Your Hand, Slave Lullabies"](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/c8f7da00-f0d8-013a-196c-0242ac110003).
    
First, spot the elements that allow you to identify the resource. Typically, these are the elements historians use to cite their sources, such as: 
- Author or creator's name
- Title of the work
- Date
- Publication information (place, publisher)
- Collection name
- Box and folder
- Repository (archive that houses the material)



1. Describe 
    a) in what way(s) you are able to access the image of the postcard: can you view, inspect, download, share the image? 
    b) are there any restrictions to the access? If so, can you explain why?
    


If you set apart the access to the image of the resource, 

information that allows you to know that this image exists, to identify it and to find it or relevant information about it

information that allows you to understand the context of creation of this resource

information that links to information available in other institutions 


the information about this resource is accessible event though the resource is either inaccessible in distance (its digital representation) or acvcessible under conditions (the physical item is accessible in the institution it is preserved if you are able to go there).  


Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable
